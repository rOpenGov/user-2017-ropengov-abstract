+ Perhaps we can leave the title "Ten simple rules..." for the possible manuscript? This way we pull less emphasis on the rules themselves. It would be ok to concentrate on the rules, but then I think we would need to come up with a more cohesive group of rules. 

+ I would talk about "programming" rather than "statistical programming", *unless* we really want to concentrate on the statistical aspects (I don't).

+ "Learners" rather than "students". To me, "students" refers too much to actual education (i.e. school, university etc), whereas "learner" is broader and more inclusive term.

+ The order of rules needs to be checked once the actual scope is decided. I didn't touch these yet as it was not completely clear what the scope actually will be.
