R is increasingly used to teach programming and quantitative analytics. Based on our combined experience from universities, research institutes, and the public sector, we will hereby summarize key ingredients for successful teaching of modern data science, facilitated by the versatile toolkit that the R ecosystem and its active user communities can provide. Such learning processes have been greatly facilitated by initiatives such as Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry, and educational resources developed by the users including tutorial collections [@Kamvar2017 ; @Lahti2017] and domain specific training materials [@Afanador2017]. An essential pedagogical feature of R is that it enables a problem-centered, **interactive learning** approach. Even programming-naive learners can, in our experience, rapidly adopt practical skills and key concepts by analyzing topical example data sets supported by ready-made Rmarkdown templates; these can provide an immediate starting point to expose the learners to some of the key tools and **best practices** [@Wilson2016]. However, many learning aspects enabled by R can be better appreciated by advanced statisticians, for instance harnessing the **open collaboration model** and its dynamic potential by joint development of R packages, ggplot themes, report templates, shiny-modules, or database function to rapidly develop solutions to concrete domain specific needs. Hence, R can be used as a teaching tools at various levels of data science expertise. At all levels, **getting things done fast**, is essential as this will provide instant rewards and helping to fluently integrate the learning process with the practical needs. The diverse needs of different application domains pose a great challenge for crafting common guidelines and materials, however. In our experience, leveraging the existing experience within the learning community can greatly support the learning process as this helps to ensure the **domain specificity** and relevance of the teaching experience for the learners. Some ways to actively promote such peer support and knowledge sharing include **code review** [@petre14], **show-and-tell culture**, informal meetings, online channels (e.g. Slack, IRC, Facebook) and hackathons. Finally, **having fun** throughout the learning process is essential; gamification of assignments with real-time rankings or custom functions performing non-statistical operations like emailing gif images can raise awareness of how R as a full-fledged programming language differs from proprietary statistical packages. In this talk, we will provide a practical overview to the various pedagogical aspects of R, and introduce specific open infrastructure that we have designed to support community-based knowledge sharing and learning in R. Our infrastructure gathers modules for constructing **domain spesific** assignments in multiple languages for various phases of data analysis in R. Assignments are coupled with automated evaluation routines and the system can be utilised openly or internally using any file sharing technology such as Github, Sharepoint or plain network drives.
