In addition to providing a powerful environment for statistical programming, R is increasingly used as a tool to facilitate modern interactive learning in statistics courses, where the student acquire skills based on a problem-solving approach. An increasing number of researchers are developing educational resources in R, such as open tutorial collections [@Kamvar2017 ; @Lahti2017], exercise materials [REF?] or presentation slides [REF?]. Simple, ready-made templates can be used as a starting point to expose the students rapidly to the available tools and best practices in statistical programming, collaborative development models, and the principles of open science, for instance. Based on our combined experience from universities, research institues, and the public sector, we have collected a set of ten simple rules, aiming to summarize key ingredients for successful teaching of modern computational science, facilitated by the versatile toolkit that the R ecosystem and its active user communities can provide. 

1. **Levels of teaching** As in all teaching, it is essential to identify the students’ prior knowledge and the overall learning goals. Many aspects enabled by R can be better appreciated by advanced statisticians than those who are still learning the basics of programming. Moreover, the academia and public sector institutions may have different needs.

2. **Interactive learning** Students can start from a simple Rmarkdown workflow and expand that.

3. **Getting things done fast** Avoid the trap of many programs and get the feeling of success. Reproducible research / workflows. Potential of R packages (targeted tools, open science, reproducible research) easier to explain to experienced statisticians that have years of experience on repetitive tasks; compared to undergraduate students. 

4. **Open science**

5. **Best practices** Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing @Wilson2016 / Tidy data principles

6. **Code review**

7. **Open collaboration model** If teaching is coupled with open collaboration model ie. straight from start using custom built R package, this can highlight the open development model and its dynamic potential. Not just a free replacement for commercial stats software but a collaborative platform for developing solutions and utilities, including ggplot themes, raport templates, rstudio-add-ins, shiny-modules, database functions etc.

8. **Educational resources** Document and archive course materials on Github and Canvas using modern sustainable techniques that facilitate collaboration and sharing. 


In summary, R community could better support teaching with R by.. collections of open teaching materials, sharing best practices etc..
