Pedagogical aspects and best practices in teaching with R

  1. Open science in practice. Good experiences that students can start from a simple Rmarkdown workflow and expand that.
  1. tidy data principles 
  1. Reproducible research / workflows. Potential of R packages (targeted tools, open science, reproducible research) easier to explain to experienced statisticians that have years of experience on repetitive tasks; compared to undergraduate students. 
  1. Code review
  1. Open collaboration model. If teaching is coupled with open collaboration model ie. straight from start using custom built R package, this can highlight the open development model and its dynamic potential. Not just a free replacement for commercial stats software but a collaborative platform for developing solutions and utilities, including ggplot themes, raport templates, rstudio-add-ins, shiny-modules, database functions etc.
  1. Levels of teaching (from beginner to advanced statisticians)

Academy vs. Public sector ?

Fast to the level of "getting things done" (avoid the trap of many programs)

Transition of Statistics courses to a modern active learning format. 

Facilitating interactive learning. 

Research and collect learning goals and existing active learning materials; facilitate the identification, development, and/or improvement of learning goals for the course; research and develop measures of students’ prior knowledge; develop activities, problem sets, pre-class preparation assignments, and other curricular materials that target the learning goals. 

Document and archive course materials on Github and Canvas using modern sustainable techniques that facilitate collaboration and sharing. 

Developing educational resources for population genetics in R: an open and collaborative approach @Kamvar2017

Textual citations, e.g., @Wilson2016 jumped over the fence, and parenthetical citations, e.g., the fence was jumped [@Wilson2016], may appear within the abstract.

R community could better support teaching with R by.. collections of open teaching materials, sharing best practices etc..
