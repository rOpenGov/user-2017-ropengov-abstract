Pedagogical aspects and best practices in teaching with R. Transition of Statistics courses to a modern active learning format. Facilitating interactive learning. 


**Open science in practice**

Students can start from a simple Rmarkdown workflow and expand that.

Reproducible research / workflows. Potential of R packages (targeted tools, open science, reproducible research) easier to explain to experienced statisticians that have years of experience on repetitive tasks; compared to undergraduate students. 

Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing @Wilson2016

Tidy data principles

**Code review**

**Open collaboration model**

If teaching is coupled with open collaboration model ie. straight from start using custom built R package, this can highlight the open development model and its dynamic potential. Not just a free replacement for commercial stats software but a collaborative platform for developing solutions and utilities, including ggplot themes, raport templates, rstudio-add-ins, shiny-modules, database functions etc.

**Levels of teaching**

From beginner to advanced statisticians.

Academy vs. Public sector ?

Fast to the level of "getting things done" (avoid the trap of many programs)


**Educational resources**

R community could better support teaching with R by.. collections of open teaching materials, sharing best practices etc..

Research and collect learning goals and existing active learning materials; facilitate the identification, development, and/or improvement of learning goals for the course; research and develop measures of students’ prior knowledge; develop activities, problem sets, pre-class preparation assignments, and other curricular materials that target the learning goals. 

Document and archive course materials on Github and Canvas using modern sustainable techniques that facilitate collaboration and sharing.
