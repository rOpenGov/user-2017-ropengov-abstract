Dedicated developer communities provide essential resources for the *R* ecosystem in the form of software packages, documentation, case studies, web applications, and other material. In 2010, we initiated the rOpenGov project [@Lahti13icml] to develop open source tools for open government data, computational social sciences, and digital humanities. We are a community of independent *R* package developers working on these topics in both public and private sector. Whereas the overall rOpenGov infrastructure is maintained by a core team, a number of independent authors have contributed projects and blog posts, supporting the overall objectives of this community-driven project. The main focus of our community is on knowledge sharing and peer support, and this has led to the release of several CRAN packages, including for instance the mature **eurostat** [@Lahti17], **pxweb**, and **gisfin** packages, and altogether over 20 projects at various stages of development and thousands of downloads per month. We welcome new contributions to the rOpenGov blog and the package collection, and participation on our online communication channels. In exchange, we aim to support the online community, provide feedback and support for package developers and initiate collaborations. Further details, full list of contributors, and up-to-date contact information are provided at the project website.
